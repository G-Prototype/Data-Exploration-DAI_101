**SmartWatch Health Data Analysis**

**Project Overview**

This project performs **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis** on a
health dataset to explore relationships between **categorical and
numerical variables**. Various visualization techniques are used to
understand the impact of factors like heart rate , blood oxygen level ,
steps taken in a day , activity level and sleep duration on stress level
of an individual. Part of the assignment given in the course
**DAI-101**.

**Dataset**

The dataset being used is the health data statistics of 10000 randomly
selected smartwatches . Contains information about the used factors
written above

**Features Analyzed**

**Categorical Variables**

-   Sleep Duration (hours)

-   Activity Level

-   Stress Level

**Numerical Variables**

-   User ID

-   Heart Rate (BPM)

-   Blood Oxygen level (%)

-   Step Count

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Univariate Analysis**

-   **Data Description**: Mean, Median, Mode, and Interquartile ranges
    of all the numerical variables.

-   **Skewness**: Skewness of all the numerical variables used.

-   **Frequency Distribution**: Frequency charts representing the
    frequency distribution of all the categorical variables.

-   **Histograms**: Histograms representing all the numerical variables
    is used.

-   **BoxPlots** : Boxplots of all the numerical variables

BoxPlots and Frequency charts are also present when the data was not
cleaned

**Bivariate Analysis**

-   **Heatmap** : Between every pair of continuous variables

-   **Box , Violin and Bar plots** : For comparing all the numerical
    variables with all the categorical variables

-   **Scatter Plots**: Understand relationships between Heart Rate and
    Sleep Duration (Based on steps taken ).

**Multivariate Analysis**

-   **Pair Plots**: Visualize multiple variable relationships
    simultaneously.

-   **Heatmap**: Analyze correlation among numerical features all at
    once.
